# base

`base` contains optimised generated code for kitex generic.
`base` is used widely in internal systems, so we expect to have a unified place for `base`.
It deprecates `Base` and `BaseResp` structs in `kitex` and `dynamicgo`

Users should not use this package, it's only for cloudwego internals.

The code under this package is generated by `fastgo` version of `thriftgo`  which we haven't released yet and is only used in a few repos. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/cloudwego/thriftgo/tree/feat-fastcodec).

Use `thriftgo` `fastgo` at your own risks. it's NOT fully tested and that's why we manually add test code in this package.
